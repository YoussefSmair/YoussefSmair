## Hi I’m Youssef Samir Kamal 👋


## a fourth-year BIS (Business Information Systems) student at Future Academy, focusing on the data and AI field.
I work with Python, Excel, and basic data handling, and I’m actively learning AI and preparing to specialize in the field in the future.

I can design clean and simple interfaces using HTML & CSS, but I don’t work as a front-end developer — I only use UI design when needed inside projects.
I also create visuals using Photoshop and basic video edits using Premiere and CapCut.

I enjoy turning ideas into working prototypes and collaborating in small teams. I’ve co-founded several college projects and contributed to both the idea and the implementation stages.

Overall, I’m building my skills toward becoming an AI professional, and I’m documenting my learning journey through small practical projects.
